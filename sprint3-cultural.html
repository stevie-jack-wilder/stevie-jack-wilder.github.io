                    <h2>Emotional Intelligence & Intellectual Intelligence</h2>
                </div>
                <br>
                <h3>EDA describes Emotional Intelligence as... </h3>
                <p>"The ability to monitor one’s own and other’s feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions." -  <em>Salovey and Mayer,</em> 1990</p>

                <p>The concept of Emotional Intelligence is a relatively new one, developed by Daniel Goleman in his book Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More than IQ. There are five elements to EQ: Self-awareness, emotional control, self-motivation, empathy, and relationship skills.</p>
                
                <p>We develop these skills in our early years through our social interactions with care givers, peers, mentors, and other individuals. These interactions create a foundation of habit in later life. But, as we will learn about in a future post, neuroplasticity is our gateway to changing habits and learning.</p>

                <p>When we have low self-awareness, we lack the ability to see how we present ourselves to, and interact with, others. It can result in egoism, or the Dunning-Kruger effect, which is a cognitive bias where people overestimate their abilities with little preparation or skill. Being self-aware means continually, but gently, interrogating yourself without judgement, to gain more pespective on yourself, a situation, or others. Self-awareness can also play a part in emotional control or regulation.</p>

                <p>When we lack empathy, we lose the ability to understand the perspectives of another. Having empathy means having capacity to feel what another person experiences, by using our own frame of reference. It is to, say, put oneself in another's shoes.</p>
                
                <p>Intellectual Intelligence is more of a general description of mental capability to reason, plan, problem-solve, think abstractly and with complexity. It also relates to how quickly we learn from both theory and experience. The measure of one's IQ is supposed to gauge how well someone is at processing those factors mentioned. The tests were developed in France over a century ago to identify students needed extra help in schools. Nowadays, there many variations of the IQ test to assess people at different ages or with specific disabilities. It is important to note, though, that elements of IQ tests can favour the answers of people from similiar cultural and social backgrounds. Can we ever really make a global standard of what Intellectual Intelligence is? </p>

                <p>Studies that have concluded that EQ is twice as important as IQ when it comes to working environments. The further up the chain in an organisation someone is, the more EQ required. Unfortunately, with EQ being a relatively new concept, many businesses across the globe still value IQ over EQ in positions that are inherently far more emotionally affected.</p>
                    
                <p>Side note: Those who understand EQ very well but are not influenced by it, in combination with a high IQ, can fall into the complex diagnosis of psychopathy... and they make great surgeons, lawyers, clergy members, and cops. </p>

                <p>What's the drive to develop your RQ? Research has found four out of six factors used to identify top performers in the tech sector are EQ skills, not IQ skills.
                <ul>IQ skills:
                     <li>A drive for achievement and expectation of standards.</li>
                     <li>Influence.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>EQ skills:
                    <li>Conceptual thinking</li>
                    <li>Analytical ability</li>
                    <li>Initiative</li>
                    <li>Self-Confidence.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>So, what are the outcomes of developing your EQ? You'll make better decisions and problem-solve more efficiently. You'll regulate your emotions better, meaning in pressured environments you will be able to be the calm in the eye of the storm. In conflict with others, your improved emotional vocabulary and active listening skills will allow you and the other(s) involved to hear each other out, understand all perspectives, and find resolutions without tempers flaring. Your capacity for empathy will increase, as will your patience for yourself and others. When you listen, you will really be hearing someone. When you reflect, it will be meaningful. And when you are given constructive criticism, you will take on the challenge to improve without any notions of attack or defence.</p>
                <br>
                Go forth, Friend. EQ may be the answer to many of your problems.
