                <h2>Learning Emotional Skills and Values</h2>

                    I thoroughly enjoyed the core skills aspects on the Foundations course, more so than I anticipated. I consider myself to have pretty good EQ, yet there is always much more to learn. The resources I have come across over the past few weeks have led me on a journey of research that I imagine will never end. I mean, how bloody interesting is the brain? (Of course, only a brain would write that.)

                    The research into neuroplasticity has had a big impact on me and provided insight into ways I self-sabotage because of prior learning environments, methods, and just straight up poor teaching. This has given me more tools in the belt to challenge this idea about myself, one I thought was fixed (or unfixable) and immovable. This will be an ongoing and long journey that I’m eager to pursue through korero with friends, whanau, mentors, and peers.

                    I have gained insight into my stubbornness when it comes to putting incredible amounts of pressure on myself to see things through alone. I am learning to reach out for help more and value that as an important part of learning. I am breaking down past work environments where reaching out for help was scolded. Equally, I have gained insight into situations in my past that have led me to that tendency to isolate myself when struggling. It has brought up some tough memories but talking through those with loved ones has taken a massive weight off my shoulders.

                    Sometimes my EQ can be a detriment, as I feel empathy for others very acutely. This drains me of resources to look after my own emotional wellbeing, so I am learning how to gain a greater balance. Being given the opportunity to reflect on these aspects of myself has been invaluable and even if, for whatever reason, I didn’t manage to finish this course, I would consider the Core Skills learning to have been worth the experience.

                    I was really surprised during my research to discover the amount of criticism levelled at the IQ testing methods, and the way in which it is set up to benefit people of similar class, culture, gender, and race as those who created it. I have far too often put too much weight on IQ, believing that there are some things I will just never understand or be able to learn, and therefore I will always be playing catch-up and not as capable as others. This learning process has really helped me gain confidence and back myself more.

                    From the outset it may seem peculiar, but it makes a lot of sense that a web development course would put such emphasis on learning emotional skills. From my awareness of the industry, there hasn’t been this focus until recent years, and the work really suffers as a result. You only need to look at the make-up of most business IT teams to see that white, middle-aged, English-speaking men are prioritised as being more valuable or skilled. No doubt this is also related to our education system that is only really now coming to terms with gender discrimination in learning spaces. Thankfully, this is changing, slowly but surely.

                    The customer base is vast and expanding day by day as we become even more reliant on online services. As that happens, the user base diversifies too. The industry needs to play catch up and stop looking at only IQ as a measure of what makes a good asset to a team. As neuroplasticity shows, anyone can be taught new skills, but it doesn’t mean they work well with people. If someone can’t work well with their colleagues, how can you expect them to work well with clients? No matter what the product or service is, people are driven by emotion, and we need to incorporate that into how we go about how we work and how we communicate.

                    Self-awareness allows us to take pause and reflect on how we come across to others, how we impact others, and how we are perceived by others. Practicing mindfulness is a great way to develop these skills. I have found that mindfulness increases capacity for patience, and when we are patient, we are more likely to actively listen to others. Active listening and looping back to each other to clarify and confirm we understand each other dramatically reduces the chance of conflict.

                    When we feel heard, we are more likely to take on feedback and do so without defensive walls up. We are able to separate what is constructive criticism of your work or processes, and not misconstrue it as judgement of you as a person. Perhaps, constructive criticism is a great gift – someone is taking time to provide you with information and that means they care. Let’s try and be thankful instead of threatened.

                    Sharing struggles really does make a difference, even though it may not feel like that when you are in the thick of a meltdown or crisis of confidence. Talking things through and being heard can bring relief and allow you more head space to get back to the issue at hand with more clarity. Also, people rarely offer help if they don’t mean it, so take it and make sure they know it is appreciated.

                    Before I started this journey, I was told that being a programmer is a career of being a problem-solver and being frustrated, and so it is imperative you really analyse how you cope (or don’t) with frustration, break it down, assess, and find methods to combat it. Frustration is an opportunity for learning and growth. It feels uncomfortable, but discomfort is an integral part of growth. And what joy you can gain when you find the solution! That, I think is ultimately worth it. The reward is so much sweeter when you know how hard you worked for it. I think it develops personal pride, and when everyone in a team has pride, you will get the best out of each other.
