      <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        There were many instances this week that I encountered blocks and needed to deploy some problem-solving methods to get through the challenges. Getting my head around the beginnings of JavaScript was a big learning curve, and I often had to remind myself of methods to push on through. The most effective ways I found were breaking down problems into smaller task-by-task issues, and working through them one by one. Looking at other people's code and pseudocode was also a huge help. I was able to see the solutions but break them a part and figure out why everything was the way it was. I ensured that I could comprehend the functionality before I then recreated my own code.

        I also really enjoyed playing around with my code once it was working, changing the order it was in, using different methods and seeing how it affected the webpage, such as changing where variables were sitting; assessing how they became global or local, and what impact that had and the rest of the code. When something broke, I was able to understand in more detail how it worked. I am definitely a person that enjoys pulling things apart to see how it works. Even if I end up with a broken toy, I understand it!

        I was introduced to so many different types of problem-solving techniques in the past few weeks and some have been better for me than others. Writing pseudocode was a great way to breakdown what the end goal was, and I could work backwards to get to that point. Such as, if X = Y, then let's figure out what X is, what other components on the page interact with X, and then same with Y. I found it be very similar to the rubber ducky method, just instead of talking it out loud, I was writing it out. Once I had figured out the issues, I rephrased my pseudocode to explain the steps. This is great for me, so I have these notes to refer back to. Also, I want others to be able to use DevTools on my pages and understand why my code is the way it is and how it functions.

        Reading error messages was also very helpful. Being directed to the lines of code that were causing issue really sped up the process of diagnosing the problem. Instead being overwhelmed by hundreds of lines of code and knowing there could be one symbol wrong, I had it narrowed down. A huge time saver! Equally, getting advice from facilitators and friends in the industry by sharing my screen and walking through the process together was just as helpful. Instead of spelling out the problems, they were great at leading me in the right direction, such as, "Have a look at your line 39. See if that looks right to you." I was often able to identify the issue without prompt. Both these methods were great guiding tools. I have not been using console.log very much. It has taken me a few weeks to get my head around how it works, but I think I understand it better now and want to make that routine, as it's wonderful to assesss functionality.

      <p>Googling is something that I tend to leave to last, as the resources available are just so vast, and I am so new to this that it is hard to discern whether you are being led down the right path or not. I think I will be able to use this much more effectively further on in bootcamp when I can better identify what a good example of code is. However, YouTube has been really great and having things explained visually was awesome. This clicked with me much quicker than text explanations. </p>
