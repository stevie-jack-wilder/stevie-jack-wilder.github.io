        <p>I have had a bit of a wild ride of experience in various television roles over the past decade, often in the back-of-house where all the mess happens, and before beautifully presented people show up at 5 o'clock to deliver you the day's news in dulcet tones. Live television does not have the luxury of time, and so I was often faced with tough decisions of where priorities lie in any given moment. Which client do I prioritise? What channel has a larger audience? Which channel has the audience most affected by my next decision? And so on, hour by hour, minute by minute.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There were many tough moments where I knew I had to make a call that ultimately meant not everyone got what they wanted, sometimes accesibility was compromised because of sheer lack of resources. So, how do you make a decision with a 10-second clock ticking down on your screen? I like to think about equity over equality when it comes to these decisions. I do my best to work in a way that results in those needing the most access, those who would suffer the most from not having access, to having priority to that information. However, sometimes we are all put in tough situations when business income is on the line, and we could talk about the ethics of that for decades.

        <p>I spent half of my upbringing in Liverpool, England, and the second-half in Whanganui-a-Tara, Aotearoa. I now live in Sydney, Australia, with my partner and very large cat. My heart very much has three homes, with each land contributing to my character. At the core of my heart, Queer is also a very important identity in terms my gender, sexuality, and community. It frames how I relate and interact with broader society, and how I communicate with people in my personal and professional lives.</p>

        <blockquote><em>"Queer not as being about who you’re having sex with (that can be a dimension of it); but queer as being about the self that is at odds with everything around it and has to invent and create and find a place to speak and to thrive and to live.” - bell hooks</em></blockquote>

        Beginning this course has been a big eye-opener into how I learn, what kind of environments I need to work well, and what causes me to lose focus. I have begun putting into practice some methods I have researched after, learning about neuroplasticity in our pre-foundations coursework, and I look forward to delving into this deeper as we go on.

        Keeping to set schedules has been a struggle so far. I tend to work in small stints and then one longer one in the evenings, which is fine working from home but not so much in a nine-to-five job. Thankfully, I adjust easy to office hours when I am in the company of other people, and it is good to have some hustle and bustle around as a reminder to take a break.

        Most importantly, I've found drawing out code into maps or trees makes a huge amount of difference to me understanding what needs to be implemented. Without visual materials, looking at code can be like deciphering Russian cursive. As a result, I have been drawing and scribbling away a lot to make sense of all this new information. It has been taking longer than I'd hoped, but I'm retaining much more and gaining a better overall understanding of each section if I don't rush myself. Overall, I have probably saved time by not needing to re-read sections over and over.
