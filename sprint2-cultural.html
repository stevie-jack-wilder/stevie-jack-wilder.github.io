            <h3>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h3>
            <p>
                I've never been a person to have a fixed mindset when it come to the future. My big interest for a long
                time has been behind the scenes television production, particularly in live environments (news, sports),
                mostly because I fell into it after gaining my Bachelor of Theatre. However, being given the opportunity
                to work with various software and be involved in the output of subtitles (or captions), has led me on a
                web development journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                he COVID-19 crisis resulted in the closure of almost all active sets, including mine, giving me an
                opportunity to re-evaluate my career path. I do not have specifics about my future, what I do know is
                I'm pretty sure coding is awesome, and I have requirements for the environments I work in.
            <ul>
                <li>Embraces diversity, continual education for staff on allyship.</li>
                <li>Well-practiced methods of conflict resolution and communication. </li>
                <li>Supportive of staff with mental health challenges.</li>
                <li>Embraces the principles of Whanaungatanga.</li>
                <li>Continuous support of minority communities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
            <p>
                Sometimes in social settings, my anxiety can get the better of me and affect how I listen or hear people.
                It feels like audio dyslexia for lack of a better term. Depending on the degree of stress I feel, my
                ability to communicate how I am feeling or calm myself down from that can vary. I have found the
                mindfulness practices we have been encouraged to explore during our study to be very helpful in giving
                me a stronger sense of calm throughout my day. I will continue to practice this so I have a better
                foundation to work with.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the past few years, I have been mostly working from home or with very few people around me, so I
                think it will be quite an adjustment, going into a campus full-time. I am a bit apprehensive but mostly
                looking forward to it. I'm aiming to push myself more socially in this experience and initiate
                conversations with others more often.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>My strengths and limitations.</h3>
            <p> 
                My strengths are that when real crisis happens, I am very calm and ordered. Despite being a fairly
                anxious person, there is something to say for what constantly prepping for disaster does to your brain.
                When it actually occurs, I often feel very clear-headed and great at delegating out tasks to resolve
                issues quickly. I am also a very creative person, and that will never change. Although I love a good
                spreadsheet, sitting around and drawing for 12 hours also sounds delightful. I hope to ultimately end up
                working with people that fosters this aspect of me, too.</p>
            <p>
                A limitation of mine is that when people around me get hot-headed or raise their voice, and their body
                language changes, I can feel under threat even if I am not involved at all. I am slowly conquering this
                reaction, but it can be quite involuntary and uncomfortable. My fight or flight kicks in. As a result, I
                can tend to avoid conflict. I would like to gain skills at EDA to manage this better. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>How I will manage the workload of the EDA Bootcamp.</h3>
            <p>I have been able to set myself up, with the support of friend and family, so that I can focus on only EDA
                during this period. This means I will commit myself to showing up every day and being engaged with the
                material and people throughout the course. I know there will be hard days, we will all have them, but I
                will communicate with staff if I find I am struggling in any way that feels beyond being able to deal
                with it myself. I am also commiting to look after my mental and physical health during this period, as
                it is just as important if I am going to be taking in so much new information. I'm looking forward to
                the yoga classes for a start.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>What I expect from the facilitators.</h3>
            <p>
                I expect the facilitators to be available during office hours for assistance with struggles I may have
                with the tech or cultural components, and also any social issues that may arise. So far, everyone has
                been great at responding to me in a timely fashion, and if they aren't available they have let me known
                when they next are. I also hope to be able to discuss personal issues with the facilitators should
                anything in my home life impact my studies. Again, all indications so far have been that this will be
                the case. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, if I am not meeting the mark in any component and it is clear that I am not aware that I have not
                understood something, I would hope a facilitator would point this out to me and send me in the right
                direction of resources to get me back on track.</p>
