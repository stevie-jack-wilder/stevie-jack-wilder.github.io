                        <h2>What is Neuroplasticity, and how can it help people?</h2>
                    <br>
                    <img class="body-images" src="./images/neuro-quote.png" alt="'Any [person] could, if [they] were so inclined, be the sculptor of [their] own brain.' - Santiago Ramon y Cajal." ></img>
                    <br>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/neuroplasticity/">Ian Cleary, 2015, explains</a> that neuroplasticity can be used to benefit people with anxiety. He says, you cannot simply stop anxiety from being triggered as it is hardwired in the brain. Instead, we need to create competitive wiring that relates to what we want to achieve, otherwise the anxiety loop continues without any new road map to take on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I drew an illustration to get my head around some aspects of the brain studied by Edmond Rolls and Schwartz in their study into Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.
                </p>
                <br>

                <br>
                <p>
                    Edmond Rolls conducted a study on monkeys, where he discovered that the orbitalfrontal cortex (OFC) not only acts as our decision-making centre, but also an error-detection circuit. From this finding, he conducted a further study on OCD in humans, a disease that <em>“... fills patients with mortal fear that something is wrong.”</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Simultaneously, Schwartz studied the caudate nucleus that sits near the OFC and is responsible for habit. He considered it could be working as a nexus where rational thinking in the cerebral cortex meets our emotion-ruled limbic system. He surmised, <em>“It would be a natural ground zero for the noxious brew of repetition and terror to collide,”</em> ... which is such a stunningly superb and accurate sentence! And here is an example of my hyperfixation: I spent four hours trying to understand how brains works with drawings and diagrams before moving on to the next reading.
                </p> 
                <br>

Winifred Sanderson brews a bubbling cauldron named Caudate Nucleaus. Left text: Limbic system - Terror, Fight/Flight.

                <br>
                <p>
                    Schwartz conducted PET scans and found hyperactivity in the OFC and caudate nucleus of OCD patients, even at rest! Their brain functions were altering even with no episode, such as a stressor to anxiety being underway. This all sounds pretty dire, but instead Schwartz took a new path. He instructed his patients to reframe their thoughts around OCD. <em>“I am a person with an urge to keep washing my hands,”</em> instead became <em>“My brain is functioning in a way that gives me the urge to wash my hands.”</em> The patients separated their personhood from their diagnoses and, as a result,  came back reporting that they didn’t feel the disease controlled them anymore, however, were still symptomatic.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    With frustration, a patient asked Schwartz why the symptoms persisted if he no longer felt as out of control as before. Rolls pulled out the PET scans and showed him, <em>“This region of the brain [the OFC] is hugely overactive.”</em>Rolls saw an instant change in the patient’s face, and those listening in on the conversation, looking at their brain scans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Seeing the evidence allowed them to move to the next step: Reattribute. There was nothing inherently wrong with any of the patients as people, instead, they have faulty wiring. They gained their sense of self back. Over time, all the patients reported huge improvements in their compulsions, being able to use methods of distraction when intrusive thoughts arose. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Schwartz found a system of steps for OCD recovery:

Refocus: Use alternate behaviour to redirect intrusive thought. Revalue: Keep track of progess, recognise and record symptom."></img>
                    <br>
                <p>
                    Another positive example of neuroplasticity is demonstrated by Dr James E. Stahl and his team of Harvard researchers through their <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0140212/">Mind-Body Relaxation Program</a> at the Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine. Over eight weeks, participants studied meditation, yoga, mindfulness, cognitive behavioural skills, and positive psychology over eight weeks. Over the next year, participants used 43% fewer medical services, clinical encounters decreased by 41.9%, and procedures decreased by 21.4%.

                    Conquer the assumption that I am not ‘good’ at certain skills or techniques. I have the capability with the right environment, resources, and plan of action. Reflection (journaling) is a good way to track progress for comparison or proof of neuroplasticity.
                    <br>
                    Put emphasis on talking with friends, mentors, and peers about learning experiences. If I can’t explain the concept of something, I haven't absorbed the teaching well-enough yet. Time to revise and practice. 
                    <br>
                    Change elements of my daily life that could be improved by habit, which in turn will give me a stronger emotional foundation that is well adapted to unpredictable situations.
                    <br>
                    Be mindful of physical and emotional state when I am studying. Am I in an optimal environment to absorb information in the first place?

                    <h2>What is Growth Mindset, why is it relevant?</h2>
                    <p>
                        We are all able to be on a learning curve. It is important we think, “Not yet,” instead of, “I can’t.” The adult brain is malleable, it is not fixed after childhood as once thought. Understanding that you have the capacity to develop your abilities and gain skills is critical to succeeding in that learning venture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Growth Mindset is not running from difficulty, finding shortcuts, dreaming about the end goal and not thinking about the critical path of learning that comes before it. And, Growth Mindset is learning from errors and correcting them, and sticking through hard moments, perseverance. This creates resilience. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Carol Dweck’s study where children were tasked with playing a math game that gave rewards for effort, strategy, and progress rather than reward for getting correct answers. As a result, students showed more effort, more strategy, more engagement, and more perseverance when encountering hard problems. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
                    <p>
                         will remember when I get frustrated and hit roadblocks that it is not impossible to climb the learning curve. I am not able to in that moment, but I will if I keep persevering. The process is the most important part of learning and I should delve in it, not try and rush through it, avoid feeling uncomfortable and frustrated. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I will do some introspection on what practical things I can implement in my routine to ease the feeling of panic when I feel my intelligence being challenged, so that I am able to persevere with learning. I do have a tendency to spiral if I feel ‘dumb’, so if I can achieve this it would make a huge difference to other parts of my life.   
                    </p>
